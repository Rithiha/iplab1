<p><b>In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, 
on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. 
The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, 
as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. 
It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity.
 The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects Eastâ€“West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line.
 A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; 
and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River,
 and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas, separating it from Europe.
China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 CE.</p></b>
